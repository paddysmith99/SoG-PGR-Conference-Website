Another way of presenting your research is by participating in our poster session. It provides an excellent way to showcase your current research and discuss informally to your peers. Posters are frequently used to communicate research during conferences, therefore the session provides a chance to produce a poster and practice delivering it. Also, the session is an opportunity to test ideas and feedback for your ongoing research. Therefore, we suggest posters are more suited to **2nd year PhD students**, however are open to all.

In order to present a poster, please contact **X\@leeds.ac.uk** by the **Xth of October,** detailing what your poster will focus on. Also, let us know if you already have a printed poster ready to go, or need help in producing one. There is a small fund that we can provide...
